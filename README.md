## 🛑 Attention Developers: Use the `dev` Branch

The `main` branch is for production-ready code only and is protected. **All development work must be done on branches based on `dev`**.

To get started, first clone the repository, then switch to the `dev` branch and pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

Then, create your new feature branch from `dev`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
